   <h3>Some interesting facts about me is that I was born in Atlanta but raised and lived most of my life in Barbados. I lived with my father and sometimes visited my grandmother and great grand mother and during the summer I would come over to visit my mother,my aunties, my uncles and my cousins. While living there I would participate in sports such as soccer and track field. I lived near the beach and would go there every weekend.</h3>
